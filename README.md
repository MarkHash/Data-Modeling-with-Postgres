# Introduction

## Purpose of this project

Startup company, Sparkify, launched their new streaming app and collected song and user activities in JSON format. This project is to proivde a database and ETL pipeline for analytics team to access and query thier data.

# Database schema design & ETL pipeline

## Database schema design

This project applies star schema consisting of following fact and dimension tables

### Fact table

1. songplays - holds log data associated with song plays, i.e. records with page `NextSong`
    - songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent

### Dimension tables

1. users - holds app user data
    - user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level
2. songs - holds song data
    - song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration
3. artists - holds artist data
    - artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude
4. time - holds timestamp data in songplays table, the data broken down into specific units
    - start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday

## ETL pipeline

Sparkify has two types of dataset (song and log dataset). This project creates two ETL piple for each dataset.

- ETL for Song dataset
    - Create dimention tables named **songs** and **artists** from song_data files
- ETL for Log dataset
    - Create dimention tables named **time** and **user** as well as fact table, **songplays** from log_data files

# Files and instructions

## Files in this repository

- `create_tables.py` drops and creates tables
- `etl.py` reads and processes files from `song_data` and `log_data` and loads them to tables
- `etl.ipynb` reads and processes a file from `song_data` and `log_data` and loads the data in to tables
- `sql_queries.py` contains all sql queries
- `test.ipynb` displays the first few rows of each table
- `README.md` discusses this project

## Run instructions

1. Run `create_tables.py` to create fact and dimention tables
2. Run `etl.py` to process data from JSON files

## Example queries and results for song play analysis

1. A query to obtain the best 5 location of their app being used
    - `%sql SELECT COUNT (songplay_id) AS TOTAL_PLAY, location FROM songplays GROUP BY location ORDER BY TOTAL_PLAY DESC LIMIT 5;`

2. A query to obtain the app usage by subscription level
    - `%sql SELECT COUNT (songplay_id) AS TOTAL_PLAY, level FROM songplays GROUP BY level;`
